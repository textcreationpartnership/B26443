            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am brought here before you, under the <hi>Accusation</hi> of being a most <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>heinous Malefactorâ–ª Impudence, Whoredom,</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> were the <hi>Crimes</hi> that those <hi>Gotham <hi>Witnesses,</hi>

Am I to <hi>answer</hi> for it, if a Man <hi>Dyes</hi> in my <hi>Company?</hi> It is not <hi>our Parts</hi> Gentlemen to <hi>keep</hi> men from <hi>Death</hi> and make them <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal;</hi> that is <hi>in their Persons,</hi> our business indeed is to make them so <hi>another way,</hi> that is, in their <hi>Posterity;</hi> and pray when have I fail'd of <hi>that</hi> as often as it lay in <hi>my way,</hi> or, I had <hi>any opportunity?</hi> Besides, what should I have <hi>got</hi> by <hi>dispatching</hi> him? What do I come into <hi>Possession</hi> of, What has he <hi>left me?</hi> I have indeed some <hi>Letters</hi> where he gives me his <hi>Heart,</hi> but as to <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Tenements, Estate Real,</hi> or <hi>Personal,</hi> there's <hi>not a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> But the very <hi>Circumstances</hi> that accompanyed, and were indeed the <hi>true cause</hi> of this <hi>Tragedy</hi> do sufficiently <hi>acquit</hi> me.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199282:4"/>Sufferers,</hi> for the <hi>like Kindness.</hi> There are many <hi>Pretty Women,</hi> (who are some Relations to me at a <hi>Distance</hi>) that are <hi>Morningly</hi> sent to the <hi>Round-House, New-Prison, Bridewell,</hi> and such <hi>horrid</hi> Places, for only doing over Night <hi>as if</hi> they were <hi>Married</hi> with some of your Worthinesses <hi>own Sex.</hi> Truly I am much afflicted at it: If <hi>Marriage</hi> be <hi>Honourable,</hi> pray why not the <hi>Imitation</hi> of it so too? The <hi>Threatre,</hi> where you Daily flock in throngs, afford no <hi>real Princesses</hi> nor <hi>Heroes,</hi> yet are the <hi>Players,</hi> (who are neither <hi>better</hi> nor <hi>worse</hi> then our selves) <hi>admired</hi> and <hi>extoll'd</hi> by you, for <hi>acting</hi> so like them. Now <hi>we play Marriage;</hi> that's all: why then are <hi>we alone</hi> Discountenanced? But suppose it be a <hi>Fault,</hi> ought not then <hi>both Parties</hi> alike to <hi>Suffer?</hi> else 'tis but the shew and <hi>shaddow</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> not the Substance; this is but <hi>acting of her:</hi> for doth any Woman lye with a Man, and not at the same time a Man lye with a Woman? But where are the <hi>Men</hi> that are <hi>beating</hi> of <hi>Hemp,</hi> for this? Where are the Men that are led by <hi>Constables</hi> and <hi>Beadles,</hi> through the Streets in Triumph? Where are the <hi>Work-houses,</hi> that they are Feasting upon <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> in? and where may we <hi>peep</hi> and <hi>flear</hi> through Prison Grates <hi>at them?</hi> No, they are no more <hi>touched,</hi> than if every <hi>Whore-master</hi> were a <hi>Justice</hi> himself. And yet we poor Souls too least deserve this <hi>Rigor.</hi> The Men are <hi>Principles,</hi> and we but <hi>Accessories</hi> at most, even in cases of our own <hi>failings,</hi> and <hi>Weakness:</hi> for are not the Men the first <hi>Aggressors?</hi> Don't they preach <hi>Guineys, Love, Wine,</hi> and all that's possible; <hi>Haunt, pursue,</hi> and <hi>watch</hi> us like <hi>unreclaimed Hawks,</hi> till they have turn'd us into being the <hi>prey?</hi> Yet we must be <hi>blamed,</hi> 'tis our <hi>faults;</hi> the <hi>Receiver</hi> you say makes the <hi>Thief:</hi> as if the <hi>Honey-pot,</hi> made the <hi>Wasps</hi> and <hi>Hornets</hi> that flock about it: or as if a Court of <hi>Admirality,</hi> should <hi>adjudge</hi> a <hi>Prize</hi> to be the <hi>Pyrate. <hi>O Times!

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199282:5"/>much as My Horse.</hi> No, most <hi>Philosophick Sages,</hi> This will never do; this is not the <hi>right Course:</hi> the <hi>Sympathy</hi> betwixt <hi>us</hi> is at an end as soon as we are out of their <hi>Arms.</hi> There's no further <hi>Motion</hi> by <hi>Consent of parts;</hi> nor, do they <hi>Pace</hi> to <hi>Church</hi> at the same time we are <hi>Spur'd</hi> and <hi>Ambling</hi> to <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well:</hi> but, if you would have us to be in earnest <hi>Righteous, <hi>Begin</hi>
               </hi> with the <hi>men,</hi> whip them <hi>first.</hi> Or (which I fear you had rather be <hi>whip't your Selves</hi> then do; nor, to speak <hi>truth,</hi> do <hi>we desire it</hi>) Give them a <hi>Good Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not be longer Tedious to so <hi>Apprehensive</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi> an <hi>Auditory:</hi> I see the marks of a generous <hi>Resentment</hi> sit already upon your <hi>Fore-Heads;</hi> go on then, most worthy <hi>Patriots,</hi> to be more <hi>Impartial</hi> in your <hi>Censures: Pity</hi> at least those whom you pretend to <hi>adore;</hi> and if you can't afford us <hi>Love,</hi> allow us <hi>Justice. Justice</hi> indeed her self, you know is <hi>Blind:</hi> Now if you can't attain to her <hi>Perfection,</hi> yet at least, <hi>Wink a little,</hi> and become as <hi>like her</hi> as you <hi>can;</hi> and henceforth, either wholly acquit us, which will be most <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Manly,</hi> or <hi>Alien</hi> not <hi>part</hi> of your Native Country, by turning <hi>Bridewell</hi> into a <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and deprive us of our <hi>Loves</hi> Society <hi>there,</hi> where both <hi>they best</hi> deserve <hi>Ours,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> have most need of their <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Comfort.</hi> So shall all such <hi>publick Spirited <hi>Virgins</hi>
